More details coming soon.

Below is a screenshot of a simple visitor count report I made for our Powerlifitng gym that just opened up a few months ago. I aim to use my Power BI and data analysis/visualization skills to gain insights on potential relationships
between visitor counts and the current marketing strategies the we've employed since the grand opening of our facility.
